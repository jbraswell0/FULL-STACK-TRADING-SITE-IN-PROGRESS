Site Outline

Overview:
	This site will allow users to store their cards (Pokemon, Yugioh, Sports, Magic etc) in an organized way online. Users can then view other users profiles and see images of that users collection. If a user is interested, they can facilitate a trade and make an offer on any card in a user's collection. The site will also include a forum that will allow users to discuss current events among other things. T+allows many ways for us to continue to expand its functionality.


Pages:

Home Page - Nice clean design that will introduce the user to the site and give an idea of what everything is all about. Can also show other users cards that are popular on the home page.




User Profile Page - Will include images of each card the user has in his/her collection. Will have an option to upload pictures of their cards. Each will require a form of authentication so that we can confirm that the user actually is the owner of that card. Will also include desired cards or interests for other users so that if another user wants to make a trade, they will have an idea of what this user may want. Will include a feedback score.


Card Image Page - When you click on a card on the users page, it will take you to this page. It will show a bigger image of the card, as well as the option to request a trade.

Forum - Will be a modern forum that allows users to discuss current events that involve sports or cards. Can split the forum into different subsections.


Trade Offer Page - Will allow the user to Offer cards from their collection for a specific card(s) of another users collection. Upon submission, it will send a notification of a trade request to another user.

Trade request Screen - Upon receiving a trade offer, when clicked, this will display the trade details with pictures of all the cards involved. Will give the option to accept, counter, or decline the offer.

AcceptedTrade Page - Once a trade is accepted, it will create a new page that includes the users addresses so that the users will be able to mail the cards to each other.
